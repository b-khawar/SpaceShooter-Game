# SpaceShooter-Game
This project is a classic space shooter game developed in C++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) for graphics rendering, input handling, and audio. Basic OOP conceepts have been used for developing the game. It's features thrilling gameplay, exciting graphics, and various challenges to keep players engaged.

# My Experience
It was also one of my initial projects, made using mere OOP concepts in C++. Anyhow, it was an up to the mark project in terms of game development.

# How to Run
1. Extract the zip file.
2. Run the object file from there.

**Note:** The C++ files other than the zip file are just to showcase the code.<br/><br/>
**Note:** Music has been removed from the zip file because of size limitations of the plattform.
