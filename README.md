# My Experience
It was also one of my initial projects, made using mere OOP concepts in C++. Anyhow, it was an up to the mark project in terms of game development.

1. Extract the zip file.
2. Run the object file from there.

**Note:** The C++ files other than the zip file are just to showcase the code.
